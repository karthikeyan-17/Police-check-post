# Police Dataset

Here,
The data from a police check post is given.

I'm going to analyze this dataset using the Pandas DataFrame

# i)Remove the missing column that only contains missing values

# ii) For Speeding, were Men or Women stopped more often?

# iii) Does gender affect who gets searched during a stop?

# (mapping + data-type casting)

# iv) what is the mean stop_duration?

# Groupby, Describe

# v) compare the age distributions for each violation
